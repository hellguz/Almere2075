# üöÄ Almere 2075 - Interactive Exhibition App

Welcome to the Almere 2075 project! This application is an interactive, web-based experience designed for an exhibition setting. It brings to life the speculative urban design work of Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar students, who reimagined the city of Almere, Netherlands, for the year 2075.

The app allows visitors to select a contemporary photograph, choose from a palette of futuristic concepts, and use AI to transform the image into a compelling vision of Almere. These transformations are guided by detailed concepts developed by students to address future challenges like flood resilience and resource scarcity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive AI Transformation:** Select an image, pick from core design concepts like 'Flood Defense' or 'Farm Towers', and watch as AI generates a unique, futuristic vision.
* **Dynamic 3D Gallery:** Explore source images in a full-screen, dynamic grid that reacts to your focus.
* **Community Gallery & Voting:** Browse all user-created transformations in a public gallery. Vote for your favorites and help shape Almere's future!
* **Gamification - The Almere Happiness Score:** Every vote contributes to a city-wide "Happiness Score." Help us reach the goal of **1000 Happy Points** by **midnight on July 13th**!
* **Dual Comparison View:** The final transformed image is displayed alongside the original in two modes:
    * **Side-by-Side:** A static comparison of the "before" and "after".
    * **Interactive Slider:** A draggable slider to dynamically reveal the transformation.
* **Generated Prompt Display:** See the exact, detailed prompt that was generated by the "Cinematic Architect" AI to guide the image model.
* **Detailed Process Logging:** A "liquid glass" style log panel appears during processing, showing the step-by-step communication with the AI backend.

## üíª Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Frontend:** React (Vite + JS) with `react-three-fiber` for the WebGL-powered gallery.
* **Backend:** A powerful FastAPI (Python) server that interfaces with AI models.
* **Database:** SQLite with SQLAlchemy for persisting generations, votes, and user data.
* **AI Models:**
    * `gpt-4-turbo` for generating creative prompts.
    * `flux-kontext-pro` via Replicate for image transformation.
* **Proxy:** Nginx serving as a reverse proxy for the frontend and backend services.
* **Containerization:** The entire stack is orchestrated with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* You must have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.

### 2. API Key & Database Configuration

The application requires API keys for OpenAI and Replicate.

* First, copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
* Next, open the new `.env` file with a text editor and add your actual API keys. The `DATABASE_URL` is pre-configured for SQLite and should not need changing.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    REPLICATE_API_KEY="r8_..."
    DATABASE_URL="sqlite:////app/database/almere_app.db"
    ```
    *This `.env` file is ignored by Git and should never be committed.*

### 3. Add Example Images

* Place your source images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) inside the `./backend/images/` directory. The application will use these to populate the gallery. Thumbnails are generated automatically on the first run.

### 4. Run the Application

The project includes separate configurations for development (with hot-reloading) and production.

* **For Development:**
    To run the app in development mode with automatic reloading when you change a file, use this command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```

* **For Production:**
    To run the optimized production version, use the default `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### 5. Access the App

* Once the containers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    [**http://localhost:2075**](http://localhost:2075)
* **For testing on other devices on your network**, find your computer's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100) and access it from your phone or tablet at `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:2075`.
